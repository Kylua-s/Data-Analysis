# Data Analysis Project - What is the Most Profitable Crop in Stardew Valley?

This repository contains a data analysis project that aims to determine the most profitable crop in the game Stardew
Valley. The analysis is based on a dataset created using data from the official wiki.

This is my first data analysis, so please provide me with some feedback.

## Project Overview

In this project, the goal is to identify and analyze the crops in Stardew Valley to determine which one generates the
highest profits. By exploring the crop data and considering factors such as growth time, selling price, and yield, we
can uncover valuable insights to guide players in maximizing their in-game earnings.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is a custom dataset created from data sourced from the official Stardew Valley wiki.
It includes information on various crops such as their growth time, selling price, and yield. The dataset is in excel
format and comprises 43 crop entries.

## Tools and Techniques

I followed the six phases of data analysis that I learned in the course. Here's a short summary of my thought process
through these six phases:

1. Ask
    - Defined the problem
        - Identified the most profitable crop in terms of gold per day to help farmers maximize their profits in the
          game.
    - Established a metric
        - Gold earned per day for each crop
    - Confirmed stakeholders' expectations
        - By comparing the gold per day for different crops, I can identify the most profitable ones.
          These insights can guide the farmers in making decisions about which crops to prioritize, allocate resources
          effectively, and ultimately optimize their profits in the game.


2. Prepare
    - Data Location
        - Stardew Valley Wiki
        - The game itself
    - Bias, Credibility, and Accuracy
        - I cross-referenced information from the wiki with the game to ensure that the data is unbiased, credible, and
          accurate.


3. Process
    - Documentation about my cleaning process.
    - In short:
        - Created and transformed data
        - Tested data
        - Cleaned the data


4. Analyze
    - Formatted my data properly
    - Used Excel tools
    - Drew conclusions


5. Share
    - Created visuals
    - Created a presentation
    - And this repository


6. Act
    - It's best to look at the presentation (pages 14 to 19)
    - In short:
        - Came to a conclusion
        - Provided my insights for each season
        - Created a plan for the hole year
